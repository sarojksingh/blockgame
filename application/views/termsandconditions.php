		</li>

			The Game commences by a ball being released from  the centre of the court in 1 of 8 different directions selected at random. The aim of the game is for players to deflect the ball with their paddle away from their side of the court towards other players.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			At the start of the Game there is a segmented wall covering each player’s side of the court. If a player misses the ball with their paddle and it hits a segment of their wall, that segment will disappear.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			If a player misses the ball with their paddle and there is no wall segment where the ball will impact, the ball is absorbed into that player’s side of the court and they are knocked out of the Game. The Game then recommences with the ball being released again from the centre of the court and a solid wall (which the ball will bounce off) being placed along the knocked out player’s side of the court.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			The speed of the ball increases incrementally every 8 paddle touche
		</li>
		<li>
			here are two ways to win the Game. Either the last player with at least 1 wall segment remaining will win the Game, if the three other players have not each been knocked out already. Or, if the other three players are knocked out while they still have wall segments, the player that is not knocked out will win the Game.
		</li>	
	</ul>
