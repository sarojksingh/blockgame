	You will notice that the colour of your nameplate and mouse cursor corresponds to your position on the Table.
    <p>
	<p>
	As the ball comes to your Wall your goal is to block it! The ball starts off slow but will quickly speed up, so be on your toes!
</p>
	<p>
	The Wall is split into 4 blocks, each of these blocks will stop the ball getting through ONLY once.  Consider it your lifeline! If the Ball gets through again you will be knocked out of the game.
